# FilterModule

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Future developments

With a little work the filter service can become independent of Angular

* Inject a more general HTTP library
* Inject a route service which can be called whenever the filter is updated
* Replace route-subscription with a updateUrl(url: string) method
